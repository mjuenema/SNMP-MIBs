bsnConfigurationSavedToNvram NOTIFICATION-TYPE
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This notification is generated whenever the device saves
         its configuration to non-volatile storage.  The system should
         limit the frequency with which this notification is generated,

         too many of these notifications.  How the frequency is limitted
         is an implementation details, but it is suggested that no more
